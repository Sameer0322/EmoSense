# Engagement Analyzer

## Introduction
The Engagement Analyzer is a sophisticated machine-learning project designed to evaluate students' focus and involvement by decoding their body language cues throughout lectures. This tool provides educators with invaluable insights, enabling real-time adjustments to teaching methodologies and fostering a dynamic and inclusive educational environment.

## Features
- **Core Node.js Development**: Learn and apply essential Node.js concepts to build backend features.
- **RESTful API Development**: Assist in developing simple RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Work with MongoDB to store and retrieve application data.
- **Real-Time Feedback Mechanism**: Provides immediate insights into students' attentiveness and engagement levels.
- **Gesture Recognition Technology**: Captures and interprets students' body language and non-verbal cues using OpenCV and other relevant technologies.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several key sections:
1. **Data Set Preparation**
   - Collecting diverse datasets encompassing various student gestures, facial expressions, and body language cues.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Conducting thorough data cleaning procedures.
3. **Feature Extraction and Selection**
   - Utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to extract key gesture patterns.
4. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Evaluating various machine learning models (CNN, RNN, SVM) and conducting comparative analyses.
5. **Testing and Evaluation**
   - Conducting comprehensive testing procedures to evaluate model performance.
6. **Deployment**
   - Implementing the system architecture for real-time data capture and analysis.
